## Installation

Download the repo:

      git clone git@github.com:IvanDerlich/weather-app.git

Move to the folder you had just created:

      cd weather-app
      
Install project dependencies:

      npm install
      
Build the project using a node script:

      npm run build
      
If the previous command doesn't open the index.html file in your default browser, then open it manually. It's located in the 'dist' folder.
